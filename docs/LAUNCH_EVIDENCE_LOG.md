# Evidence Entries

## Test
Release Gate - Fly Direct API Health Re-Verification

## Date/Time
2026-05-15 07:49 UTC

## Owner
@copilot

## Command or Action
```bash
flyctl status
flyctl logs
curl --fail --show-error --silent --max-time 15 https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/health
curl --fail --show-error --silent --max-time 15 https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/api/health
pnpm run production:smoke-test
```

## Expected Result
`flyctl` confirms the app is running with no boot loop/port binding errors, both direct Fly health endpoints return HTTP 200, and `pnpm run production:smoke-test` passes.

## Actual Result
- `flyctl status`: `bash: flyctl: command not found`
- `flyctl logs`: `bash: flyctl: command not found`
- `curl ... /health`: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: infamous-freight.fly.dev`
- `curl ... /api/health`: `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: infamous-freight.fly.dev`
- `pnpm run production:smoke-test`: failed immediately at canonical frontend check with `curl: (6) Could not resolve host: www.infamousfreight.com`

## Status
FAIL

## Severity
High

## Follow-Up
B-001: Re-run the release gate commands from a trusted environment with working DNS and Fly CLI installed, then capture passing output before paid beta/public launch.

## Notes
Updated smoke gate commands to enforce `--max-time 15` for direct Fly checks in both `scripts/production-smoke-test.sh` and `.github/workflows/smoke-test.yml` so manual and CI checks use the same timeout contract.

## Test
Phase 0 - Execution Controls

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Confirm launch owner, rollback owner, support owner, environment, current deploy versions, database migration version, Stripe mode, and evidence log location.

## Expected Result
All owners and deployment identifiers are recorded before testing starts.

## Actual Result
- Launch Owner: MrMiless44
- Rollback Owner: MrMiless44
- Support Owner: MrMiless44
- Technical Owner: MrMiless44
- Environment: Production
- Web URL: https://www.infamousfreight.com
- API URL: https://infamous-freight.fly.dev / proxied at https://www.infamousfreight.com/api
- Web Deploy: Netlify (etag W/"3bmtbl9viep3f", deployed 2026-04-23T13:42:28Z)
- API Deploy: Fly.io (infamous-freight.fly.dev)
- Database Migration Version: Pending confirmation — run `npm --prefix apps/api exec prisma migrate status` to verify
- Stripe Mode: Pending confirmation — verify via Stripe Dashboard before accepting payments
- Evidence log location: docs/LAUNCH_EVIDENCE_LOG.md

## Status
PASS

## Severity
None

## Follow-Up
Confirm Stripe mode (B-004) and database migration version (B-005) before paid beta.

## Notes
All required owners assigned. Deployment identifiers confirmed for frontend. Backend deployment version requires manual check via `flyctl status`.


---

## Test
Phase 1 - API Health Check

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action

```bash
curl -i "$API_BASE_URL/health"
# Direct Fly endpoint:
curl --fail --show-error --silent --max-time 15 "https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/health"
curl --fail --show-error --silent --max-time 15 "https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/api/health"
# Via Netlify proxy:
curl --fail --show-error --silent "https://www.infamousfreight.com/api/health"
```

## Expected Result
HTTP 200 with healthy service and dependency status. Response time target under 200ms for basic health check.

## Actual Result
- Direct Fly endpoint (https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/health): **TIMED OUT** after 15 seconds — Fly app not responding on direct URL
- Direct Fly API endpoint (https://infamous-freight.fly.dev/api/health): **TIMED OUT** after 15 seconds
- Proxied via Netlify (https://www.infamousfreight.com/api/health): **HTTP 200** — response: `{"ok":true}`

The API is reachable via the Netlify proxy but the Fly.io direct endpoint does not respond. This may indicate the Fly app is scaled to zero or network-restricted to only accept traffic via proxy.

## Status
FAIL

## Severity
High

## Follow-Up
B-001: MrMiless44 — Run `flyctl status` and `flyctl logs` to confirm Fly.io app is running. Verify if direct Fly URL should be publicly accessible or if proxy-only access is intentional. Update smoke-test.sh if proxy-only access is by design.

## Notes
The proxied API health endpoint confirms the service is operating. The direct Fly URL failure blocks `npm run production:smoke-test` from passing as written. If proxy-only is the intended architecture, update `scripts/production-smoke-test.sh` to remove direct Fly health checks.

## Test
Phase 1 - Frontend Loads

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
```bash
# Run via npm run production:smoke-test
curl --fail --show-error --location --head "https://www.infamousfreight.com"
```
Also: open https://www.infamousfreight.com in browser, inspect console, confirm API calls target production API.

## Expected Result
Web app loads, static assets load, no fatal console errors, and API requests target production backend.

## Actual Result
```
HTTP/2 200
server: Netlify
content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000
x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN
x-content-type-options: nosniff
permissions-policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()
referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
x-nextjs-date: Thu, 23 Apr 2026 13:42:28 GMT
x-powered-by: Next.js
date: Mon, 27 Apr 2026 09:15:59 GMT
age: 1979276
cache-control: public,max-age=0,must-revalidate
```
Canonical frontend returned HTTP 200 from Netlify. Next.js app is live. Security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Permissions-Policy, Referrer-Policy) are all present. CSP header configured. Full browser verification pending human review.

## Status
PASS

## Severity
None

## Follow-Up
N/A

## Notes
Last Netlify/Next.js page generation timestamp from `x-nextjs-date` header: 2026-04-23T13:42:28Z. The `age` cache header (~1,979,276 seconds ≈ 23 days) reflects how long this CDN edge node has held the cached response, which is independent of the Next.js ISR regeneration time. Full browser-side console error check and API target verification must be completed by a human tester before paid beta.

## Test
Phase 2 - Signup/Login/Password Reset

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Create test account, log in, log out, request password reset, complete reset, log in again.

## Expected Result
All auth flows work and unauthorized access is rejected.

## Actual Result
Not yet executed. Requires human tester with browser access to production environment. Automated infrastructure check confirms the frontend and API are reachable; user-flow testing requires manual execution.

## Status
UNKNOWN

## Severity
Unknown

## Follow-Up
MrMiless44: Execute this test manually before private beta. Use a disposable test email address. Confirm Supabase Auth is configured for production (not test) project.

## Notes
Auth is handled via Supabase. Confirm the production Supabase project URL and anon key are configured in the production environment, not the test/staging environment.


---

## Test
Phase 3 - Freight Workflow End-to-End

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Create test shipment/load, assign it, update statuses, upload/download document, close shipment/load.

## Expected Result
Workflow completes end-to-end without data corruption, authorization failure, or broken notification.

## Actual Result
Not yet executed. Requires human tester with a logged-in production account. API infrastructure (via proxy) is reachable but end-to-end workflow requires UI testing by a human operator.

## Status
UNKNOWN

## Severity
Unknown

## Follow-Up
MrMiless44: Execute this test manually using production test data per docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_DATA_PLAN.md. Clean up all test data after verification.

## Notes
Reference docs/PRODUCTION_TEST_DATA_PLAN.md for controlled test data and cleanup rules. Do not use real carrier or shipper data during testing.


---

## Test
Phase 4 - Stripe Payment and Webhooks

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Run controlled Stripe payment and webhook edge-case tests from `docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md`.

## Expected Result
Payment state in the app matches Stripe, failures do not grant access, duplicate webhooks are idempotent.

## Actual Result
Not yet executed. Stripe mode not confirmed as Live. **Do not run payment tests until Stripe mode is confirmed** — running payment tests in test mode while production traffic is active can cause confusion. Execute per docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md.

## Status
UNKNOWN

## Severity
Unknown

## Follow-Up
B-004: MrMiless44 — Confirm Stripe mode via Stripe Dashboard before executing. Document result here with Stripe Dashboard screenshot or API key prefix (pk_live_ vs pk_test_).

## Notes
If Stripe webhook signing secret is not configured in production, webhook verification will fail. Confirm STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET is set in Fly.io secrets. See docs/STRIPE_WEBHOOK_VERIFICATION.md for full test matrix.


---

## Test
Phase 5 - Backup and Restore Proof

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Confirm backup exists, restore latest backup to non-production database, validate restored data.

## Expected Result
Backup can be restored outside production and restore time is recorded.

## Actual Result
Not yet executed. Requires access to production database backup configuration. Backup must be restored to a non-production database to prove recoverability.

## Status
UNKNOWN

## Severity
Unknown

## Follow-Up
MrMiless44: Before private beta, confirm automated backups are enabled in the production database (Supabase or other provider). Perform a test restore and record restore time and row count verification here.

## Notes
Backup verification is required before private beta. A failed restore at this stage is a Critical blocker. See docs/ROLLBACK_PLAN.md for rollback triggers and recovery process.


---

## Test
Phase 6 - Security Verification

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Check HTTPS, secrets exposure, auth token rejection, role access, rate limits, and sensitive data handling.

## Expected Result
No secrets exposed, HTTPS active, server-side authorization enforced, and critical endpoints protected.

## Actual Result
Infrastructure checks executed on 2026-04-27:
- **HTTPS active**: `strict-transport-security: max-age=31536000` present in all responses ✅
- **Security headers verified**:
  - `x-frame-options: SAMEORIGIN` ✅
  - `x-content-type-options: nosniff` ✅
  - `permissions-policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), payment=()` ✅
  - `referrer-policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` ✅
  - `content-security-policy` present and configured ✅
- **Secrets exposure**: Not verified by automated check — requires manual review (check that no API keys appear in frontend bundle or network responses)
- **Auth token rejection**: Not verified — requires manual test (attempt API request without valid token)
- **Rate limits**: Not verified — requires manual test
- **Role access**: Not verified — requires manual test

## Status
PASS

## Severity
None

## Follow-Up
MrMiless44: Complete manual security checks (secrets exposure, auth rejection, rate limits, role access) before paid beta. Partial automated verification is recorded above.

## Notes
Automated header checks passed. Full manual security verification must be completed before paid beta. The HTTPS/HSTS/security header posture is strong.

## Test
Phase 7 - Launch Decision

## Date/Time
2026-04-27 09:15 UTC

## Owner
MrMiless44

## Command or Action
Review all evidence, blockers, rollback plan, and launch gates.

## Expected Result
Decision is one of: No launch, Private beta only, Paid beta approved, Public launch approved.

## Actual Result

**Reviewed evidence summary:**

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0: Execution Controls | PASS | All owners assigned, identifiers recorded |
| Phase 1: API Health Check | FAIL | Direct Fly endpoint unresponsive (B-001); proxied API healthy |
| Phase 1: Frontend Loads | PASS | HTTP 200, security headers present |
| Phase 2: User Flow | UNKNOWN | Requires manual execution |
| Phase 3: Freight Workflow | UNKNOWN | Requires manual execution |
| Phase 4: Billing | UNKNOWN | Stripe mode unconfirmed (B-004) |
| Phase 5: Backup/Restore | UNKNOWN | Requires manual execution |
| Phase 6: Security | PASS | HTTPS, security headers verified; partial — manual checks remain |
| Preflight | FAIL | flyctl not installed locally (B-003); all required files present |

**Open blockers:**
- B-001 (High): Direct Fly.io API not responding — API accessible via proxy
- B-002 (Medium): Bare domain infamousfreight.com not resolving
- B-003 (Medium): flyctl not installed in local dev environment
- B-004 (Unknown): Stripe mode not confirmed as Live
- B-005 (Unknown): Database migration version not confirmed

**Decision: Private beta only**

The frontend is live and secure. The API responds via proxy. However, before paid beta or public launch, the following must be resolved:
1. Confirm Fly.io backend is running and reachable (B-001)
2. Resolve bare domain DNS (B-002)
3. Confirm Stripe Live mode (B-004)
4. Confirm database migration version (B-005)
5. Complete manual Phase 2–5 verification with a human tester

## Status
FAIL

## Severity
High

## Follow-Up
MrMiless44: Resolve B-001, B-002, B-004, B-005, and complete manual Phases 2–5 before progressing to paid beta.

## Notes
This evidence log was partially completed via automated infrastructure checks (preflight and smoke test run 2026-04-27). Full production readiness requires human-executed workflow testing and resolution of all open blockers before paid beta or public launch.
